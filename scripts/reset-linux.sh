# Comfy Desktop -- Linux reset script
#
# Wipes app settings, caches, and the Chromium profile for the current build
# AND for the older beta names (ComfyUI Launcher / comfyui-launcher), in case
# leftovers from a previous version are breaking the UI (no styles, no i18n,
# dropdowns not working, etc.) after a manual update.
#
# Does NOT touch your actual ComfyUI installs at ~/ComfyUI-Installs. The
# script DOES remove installations.json (the registry), so you may need to
# re-add existing installs via "Add existing installation" on first launch.
#
# Usage:
#   bash reset-linux.sh         # asks for confirmation
#   bash reset-linux.sh --yes   # skip confirmation
