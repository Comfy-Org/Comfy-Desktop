/**
 * `comfy://` deep-link resolution.
 *
 * The OS hands us an arbitrary string when a `comfy://` link is opened.
 * This module turns it into a fully-qualified cloud URL, or `null` when
 * the input is anything we don't explicitly trust. It is deliberately
 * pure (no Electron, no I/O) so the allowlist can be exhaustively
 * unit-tested — the security of the feature lives here.
 *
 * Supported shapes:
 *   comfy://open?path=/workflows/123      → https://cloud.comfy.org/workflows/123
 *   comfy://open?url=https://cloud.comfy.org/x → https://cloud.comfy.org/x
 *
 * Security model: the resolved URL's origin MUST be in CLOUD_ALLOWLIST.
 * Anything that resolves to another origin or scheme — including
 * protocol-relative `//evil.com` tricks smuggled through `path` — returns
 * `null`. We never return a non-cloud URL.
