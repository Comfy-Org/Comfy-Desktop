/**
 * Tie the anonymous `installation_id` to the signed-in user so PostHog
 * merges the two identities. Both auth paths (Google server-side,
 * GitHub popup) converge on the resolved Firebase `user` record, so this
 * is the single hook that covers every sign-in.
 *
 * Person properties shipped:
 *   - `email` — raw address. Industry-standard for product analytics
 *     and the only practical way to support "what did <person> do"
 *     lookups for support / debugging without a two-system round-trip
 *     through Firebase Admin. PostHog's `$email` field also lights up
 *     the person card with an avatar + email so persons-view search
 *     by email works as expected.
 *   - `email_domain` — cohort filter (e.g. comfy.org A/B targeting).
 *     Kept alongside the raw email so existing filters / experiments
 *     don't have to derive it at query time.
 *   - `signed_in_via: 'desktop_2'` — every event from this person from
 *     here on inherits this, so cloud-side events (when the user later
 *     interacts with the embedded cloud workspace) are attributable to
 *     a desktop-originated sign-in. Covers the case where the OAuth
 *     flow itself runs in the system browser (no cloud.comfy.org
 *     pageview during auth, so utm_source alone can't carry it).
 *   - `signed_in_at_ms` — epoch-ms of the most recent sign-in. Useful
 *     for "users who signed in within the last N days" cohorts.
 *
 * `bindUserId` is consent-gated downstream — a user who declined
 * telemetry binds nothing. Wrapped so a telemetry failure can never
 * break the auth flow.
